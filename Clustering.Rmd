#First I will import the CSV data into R as a data frame called "D1"
D1 <- read.csv("online-tutor.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

#Then I explored the data a little bit
plot(D1$height, D1$score)
plot(D1$height, D1$hints)
plot(D1$score, D1$hints)
cor(D1)
mean(D1$height)

#Then I tried doing some kmeans clustering
D2 <- dplyr::select(D1, 4:5)
Cluster <- kmeans(D2, 3)

#OK, let's try exploring this thing we just created
table(Cluster$centers)
plot(Cluster$cluster, D1$hints)

#OK, I have some clusters. Now to plot them in ggplot!
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
Cluster$cluster <- as.factor(Cluster$cluster)
ggplot(D1, aes(hints, score, color = Cluster$cluster)) + geom_point()

#It looks like I now have three distinct clusters in my data. I'm not sure how it adds value or insight to the analysis, but at least the code is working(ish)!
